## Opinions

- UUIDs for unique identifiers generated by prefab.
- JWT for authorization tokens and cookies.
- Functional options pattern for configuring services and plugins, with
  configuration fallback.

## Key dependencies

- GRPC and GRPC Gateway ... obviously.
- Viper for configuration.
- Zap was chosen as default logging library.
- Gomail for sending emails, defaults to SMTP but can be customized.
- [TK] for templating. (e.g. for default login page)

## Plugins

Plugins are essentially server scoped singletons.

Plugins expose a `Name()` method which returns a string used for querying
plugins and for dependency resolution.

Plugins may expose a `Deps()` method which returns a list of names of plugins
that should be initialized before hand.

Plugins may expose a `ServerOptions()` method, which allows for the registration
of HTTP handlers, GRPC handlers, and interceptors.

Plugins may expose an `Init()` method, which is called when the server starts
up, this can be used for getting references to other plugins.

By convention, plugins should be created by a `Plugin` function. If the plugin
is intended to be used by other plugins, it's name should be exported as
`PluginName`. For example, `gpt.Plugin(...)` and `gpt.PluginName`.
