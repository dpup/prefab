            Please evaluate this issue:

            1. Determine if it's clear, actionable, and reasonable to implement
            2. If implementable:
               - Create an implementation plan
               - Attempt to implement the fix or feature following project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
               - Create a pull request with your changes
            3. If not clear enough:
               - Ask clarifying questions
               - Request additional context

            Focus on following the project's Go conventions and testing practices.
