# Claude Automation Configuration
#
# This file documents the access controls for Claude AI automation workflows.
# The workflows use the official anthropics/claude-code-action.

# Access Controls
#
# @claude Mentions (claude-mention.yml):
#   - Anyone can mention @claude in issues and PRs
#   - Claude will respond to any @claude mention
#
# Code Reviews (claude-review.yml):
#   - Automatically reviews all PRs except:
#     - PRs from claude/* branches (avoids reviewing own work)
#     - Draft PRs
#     - PRs with 'skip-claude-review' label
#
# Issue Evaluation (claude-issue-eval.yml):
#   - Auto-triggers for team members (OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR)
#   - External contributors need 'claude:evaluate' label added by a team member
#   - Claude will evaluate and may create implementation PRs

# Workflow Behavior
#
# All workflows use the official anthropics/claude-code-action which:
# - Automatically detects context (interactive mode vs automation)
# - Has access to repository files and GitHub APIs
# - Can create branches, commits, and pull requests
# - Uses CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidelines

# Cost Control
#
# To control API usage:
# - Add 'skip-claude-review' label to skip PR reviews
# - Only add 'claude:evaluate' label for issues you want Claude to implement
# - Draft PRs are automatically skipped
# - Team members have full access to all features
